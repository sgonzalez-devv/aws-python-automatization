# aws-python-automatization
This AWS Lambda Scraper automates the extraction of Lambda function details using Selenium, including name, description, runtime, layers, API endpoint, and method. It logs into AWS, paginates through the Lambda list, saves data to a CSV file, and ensures safe interruption (Ctrl + C) without losing progress.
